rework phils libraries
 
more examples in documentation

use macro annotations where appropriate
add debug assertions for undefined behavior etc (but have it say it's UB)
have assertion in header in inline function that calls an impl
function defined in the .cpp
ensure it functions properly with min and max macros defined
(std::numeric_limits<int>::max)() for instance.

minimize header dependencies
use PIMPL whereever possible (non-template classes)
always use source, destination style interfaces.
always use haystack, needle style interfaces.
remove code duplication
document everything
static analyzers
test everything
make it build with gcc, clang, msvc15, msvc17, MinGW
add a README.md describing the components
add LICENSE.md
linux and windows build scripts for (.lib)
how to generate documentation
running the tests

get rid of the history by deleting the remote repo,
creating a new one and pushing to just the raw sources to that new repo.
