 * \def PL_RESTRICT
 * \brief Declares a pointer as a restrict pointer.
 * \warning If an independent pointer accesses the object pointed
 *          to by the pointer declared with PL_RESTRICT
 *          undefined behavior occurs.
 *
 * For the lifetime of the pointer declared with PL_RESTRICT
 * only the pointer itself and values directly derived
 * from the pointer (such as pointer + 1) may be used to access the
 * pointed to object. Using this macro when appropriate may aid
 * compiler optimizations as the effects of pointer aliasing are limited.
