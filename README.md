# philslib
A C++ header-only library of various utilities.  
This library exists to not have to implement the same   
functionality over and over again in different projects.  
The library implements some C++17 standard library features, as well as  
some features of some of the technical specifications.  
Additionally it provides portable versions of otherwise non-portable functions, as well as
some other utilities.  

## Prerequisites
- A C++14-capable C++ compiler  
- CMake (to build the tests)  
- Doxygen (to generate the documentation)  


## Compilers
The library code and the test code is known to function with:  

- g++ 5.4.1 and newer
- clang++ 3.8 and newer
- msvc15 and newer
 
 
## Installation
As this is a header-only library all you have to do is  
add the `include` subdirectory to your compiler's  
include path.  


## Disabling optional C++17 features
The library optionally uses some C++17 features such as `[[nodiscard]]` and `[[fallthrough]]` if the compiler being used is new enough to support them.  
You can disable C++17 features, even if your compiler supports them, by defining the `PL_NO_CPP17` preprocessor symbol.  
It is recommended to define the `PL_NO_CPP17` globally through your build system, rather than in the source directly.  


## Generating the documentation
To generate the documentation run:  
`doxygen ./Doxyfile `  
To view the generated html documentation using firefox run:  
`firefox ./doc/html/index.html &`

navigate into the subdirectory named  
`Debug_x86`,  
`Release_x86`,  
`Debug_x64`, or  
`Release_x64`,  
depending on which version was built.

## Components
This header-only library in the include subdirectory is sub-divided into 5 parts.  

- The algorithm component, corresponding to the algo subdirectory, which implements generic algorithms.  
- The container component, corresponding to the cont subdirectory, which implements utility functions operating on container-like objects.  
- The metaprogramming component, corresponding to the meta subdirectory, which implements various meta functions.  
- The threading component, corresponding to the thd subdirectory, which implements utilities with regard to multithreading.  
- As well as a generic component, corresponding to the header files directly within the include/pl directory, for all other utilities.
