 * \def PL_VLA(type, identifier, size, ...)
 * \brief Creates a VLA. 'type' is the type of the elements that the VLA
 *        will store. 'identifier' is the identifier of the VLA.
 *        'size' is the amount of objects of type 'type' that the VLA will
 *        store.
 *        Pass an object with which to initialize the objects in the
 *        VLA by copy construction into the macro varargs.
 * \warning Internally uses PL_ALLOCA. Beware of stack overflow. See the
 *          documentation of PL_ALLOCA.
 * \see PL_ALLOCA
 * \note If the type contains a comma such as
 *       std::unordered_map<int, std::string>
 *       you have to use a type alias for that type, rather than using the type
 *       directly so that the comma effectively disappears.
