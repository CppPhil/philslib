 * \def PL_ALLOCA(count_bytes)
 * \brief Allocates 'count_bytes' bytes of raw memory that is local to the
 *        current function. That memory is allocated from the stack.
 *        The memory allocated is automatically deallocated when the
 *        current function returns to its caller.
 *        The macro 'returns' a pointer to that memory, which is of type void *.
 * \warning Using this macro can easily cause stack overflow.
 *          Do not allocate large amounts of bytes in one function using
 *          PL_ALLOCA. Beware of functions using PL_ALLOCA potentially being
 *          inlined, you may want to declare functions using PL_ALLOCA as
 *          PL_NEVER_INLINE. Beware of using PL_ALLOCA, or a potentially
 *          inlined function that uses PL_ALLOCA in a loop or in a recursive
 *          function. If the program causes stack overflow, the behavior of
 *          the program is undefined.
 *          Make sure that the 'count_bytes' supplied is safe, i.e. not
 *          supplied by the user or some external source.
